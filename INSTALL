Building results in:

1. IDL files (some are provided, others are created at build time)

   src/*.thrift
   src/*.proto

2. Language modules (depending upon which languages are found on your system)

   src/pb-python
   src/pb-cpp
   src/pb-java
   src/pb-perl 
   src/thrift-python
   src/thrift-cpp
   src/thrift-java
   src/thrift-perl
   src/thrift-c

   
'make install' will result in the IDL files, and language directories being
copied to $PREFIX/lib/cif-protocol/

Example code is in src/$IDL-$LANG/

For example, to see how to use the messages with protocol buffers in python:

src/pb-python/test.py
