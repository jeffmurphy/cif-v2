If you are working off of a git clone:

 $ ./rebuild.sh
 $ make install

which assumes you have automake, etc, installed.

If this is a distribution:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install


Building results in:

1. IDL files (some are provided, others are created at build time)

   src/*.thrift
   src/*.proto

   You should accept the default (--with-prebuilt-xsd2idl=yes), which 
   uses the "prebuilt" proto/thrift files.
   
   For example, the iodef (RFC5070) prebuilt has been hand edited to fix 
   things that xsd2idl does not translate properly. 
   
   Basically avoid xsd2idl unless you know what you are doing.
   
2. Language modules (depending upon which languages are found on your system)

   src/pb-python
   src/pb-cpp
   src/pb-java
   src/pb-perl 
   src/thrift-python
   src/thrift-cpp
   src/thrift-java
   src/thrift-perl
   src/thrift-c

   
'make install' will result in the IDL files, and language directories being
copied to $PREFIX/lib/cif-protocol/

'make install' will also install the perl module system-wide

the python module will not be installed system-wide. see src/pb-python/README

Example code is in src/$IDL-$LANG/test.*


For example, to see how to use the messages with protocol buffers in python:
