Welcome
-------

These are the core message protocols for cif. The central message
is CIF.msg.MessageType (src/msg.proto) and other message types 
(CIF.msg.FeedType [feed.proto] as well as the various 'standardized' 
messages like IODEF, IDMEF, etc) are placed inside of MessageType.


This package is a foundational piece of CIF and other CIF packages 
expect it to be installed first.

The intent of this package is to bring together the various protocol
message definitions that CIF will support 'out of the box'. 

Additionally, this package will construct language bindings for you
(if you have 'protoc' and/or 'thrift' installed). 

All of the files (IDL files, language bindings) are installed into
/usr/local/lib/cif-protocol (default) and other CIF package will 
look there.

At the moment, protocol buffers (protoc) must be installed to take
advantage of this package, otherwise the language bindings will not
be built and other CIF modules will not work. In the future Thrift
may be added.
